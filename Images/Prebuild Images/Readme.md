```

Raspberry Pi OS Desktop / Debian Bullseye / 64Bit
```

```


## Usage

The Image should be written to an SD card with Raspberry Pi Imager

## First Steps

After the Pi is started guvcview and Chromium will open (This could take some time cause the script waits for an active Internetconnection)

For the first time you can close all open Applications and set up an Connection to your network (Cabled or Wifi doesn't matter) then restart the Pi


Open Chromium and navigate to
```
localhost:3180
```

Now autodarts can be configured
