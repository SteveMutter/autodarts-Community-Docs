## Calculation of opening angle, working distance and oject size

> Dartboard including standard surround has 69 cm (690 mm) outside diameter

> Distance lens webcam to center bullseye (e.g. 34cm (340mm))

> Results in an optimal lens size of 90.8° (thus a standard commercially available lens of 90°)
