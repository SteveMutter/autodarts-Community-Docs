## KNOWLEDGE ABOUT REDOLUTION AND FPS (Frame-Rate)

###### Does lowering resolution increase FPS?

Yes it will, it is the only factor that affects fps more than graphics settings. For example,
changing the graphics settings from very low to ultra will about double your fps but changing
resolution can x8 your fps. For gaming people tend to play these common 16:9 resolutions
720p(720 * 1280), 900p(900 * 1600), 1080p(most common 1080 * 1920), 1440p (1440 *
2560), and finally the glorious 4k (2160 * 3820). (I knew all of those of the top of my head
Take the highest resolution with that your hardware can work stable. Only play at a lower
resolution if you are playing on a very low end machine. Anyways back to fps: the more total
pixels the lower fps you will get. For example 720 * 1280 = 920,000 while 1080 * 1920 =
2,000,000 so this means since 1080p has about twice as many pixels as 720p downgrading
from 1080p to 720p will about double your fps ex: 30fps -> 60fps. Meanwhile I would say the
bare minimum playable resolution is 900p and since 900 * 1600 = 1,400,000 downgrading
from 1080p (2,000,000 pixels) will about x1.5 your fps ex: 30fps -> 45fps. Anyways enough
details here are the raw numbers: 1440p is twice as many pixels as 1080p and 4k is twice as
many pixels as 1440p so the fps will change respectivley. (This means 4k is 4 timmes as
many pixels as 1080p so 1080p is 4x higher fps ex: 30fps -> 120fps).

**For sure. This information is from a „Gaming-Portal“. But here you understand how mighty a
big resolution can be for a low performance hardware.**

###### Does lowering brightness increase FPS?

Decreasing the brightness to 0 (or less more) will remove lag and increase fps. On desktops the
graphics card controls the brightness and contrast so there is no issue there. So if you have a low end
computer put graphics brightness to 0 (you have to try what`s best for you). Not to confuse that with
the display brightness, those are 2 different brightness. And lower the contrast us much us possible.

###### How to Increase the FPS on Your Webcam

> A camera in low light may reduce the frame rate and resolution in an attempt to
> capture more light. Try unchecking the Low Light setting.

> But also to much Light (Brightness) is also a problem. You have to find a middle way.
> Better is a bit lowering the light than to mutch brightness. Do and try…

> Try reducing the Exposure to 64 or less. This will make the FPS rise up to nearly 30.
> And then rise the Brightness or Gamma a little to compensate for brightness.
