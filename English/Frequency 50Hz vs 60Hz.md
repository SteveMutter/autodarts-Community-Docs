## Frequency 50Hz vs. 60Hz

With many surveillance and web cameras it is possible to set the frequency
to 50Hz, 60Hz or outdoor. 
But what is the purpose of this setting and what does it do? This is related to the frequency of the power grid.
The power grid in the USA, for example, runs on a grid frequency of 60Hz.

In Germany the frequency is 50Hz. This also affects lamps. If you want to
know exactly what the power grids look like worldwide, you can read about
it on Wikipedia, there is also a map there. In Europe 50Hz is used.

My guess is that internally the exposure time of the surveillance camera is
adjusted accordingly. 

I haven't been able to check this yet because we
can't usually retrieve these values and they aren't listed in the metadata
either.

However, I know this concept from filming (FPS, lamps, exposure time)!

Experiment with a film camera
> 1. I'm filming a lamp, 50Hz, 24 fps and 1/50 shutter speed. The picture is
> flawless nothing flickers.

> 2. I'm filming a lamp, 60 Hz, 24 fps and 1/50 shutter speed. The picture
> flickers!
