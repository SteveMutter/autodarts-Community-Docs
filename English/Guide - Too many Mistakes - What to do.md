## Autodarts makes too many mistakes. What should i do?

AVOID MECHANICAL MISTAKES LIKE ->

+ Check your calibration before starting a game. Try to recalibrate your system. Use in calibration mode (config) STRG
and + to zoom in to board to make it bigger. After set take a look. Sometimes it is only a pixel up/down left/right.

+ All screws oft light ring, wiring cables, cam holders, Dartboardholder should be strong fixed. No vibrations by the
surround or anything. Screws are the best thing for fixing it strong. Nothing should move during the game. Number
ring also sometimes produce vibrations.

+ The LED / light surround should also be stable enough mounted. Take a look how mutch KALVIN the LED stripe has.
To less and to mutch both things are not good. Normally original target Stripe has 120 LED with 6000K. A Dimmer
would be good if you are not sure.

+ There should be no external strong light sources (natural like sun odr artifical) directed on the dartboard. Most error
sequence is if the light surround shining directly into the webcam (LED flickering you cant see with hum eyes!)

+ For higher accuracy sometimes helps if you avoid dark coloured points, barrels and shafts

+ Use a spirit level to check if your wall and your dartboard are mounted correctly in the vertical, diagonal and horizontal directions
